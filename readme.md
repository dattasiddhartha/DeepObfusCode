### DeepObfusCode

Automated source code obfuscation with sequence-to-sequence network. 

Code repository for [DeepObfusCode: Source Code Obfuscation Through Sequence-to-Sequence Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01837). [pip](https://pypi.org/project/deepobfuscode/) package also available.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Import `deepobfuscode` as library, and install required dependencies. [Obfuscation tests](https://github.com/dattasiddhartha-1/dsource) for reference.

1. Run `encryption/encryption()` to generate obfuscated code, then generate keys and verify evaluation with `encryption/decryption()`.
2. Run `execution/obfuscated_execution()` to execute obfudcated code.
